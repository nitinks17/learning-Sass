Sass-Syntacticaly Awesome  Style Sheet,and its an extension to CSS,using sass we it become easy for us to write css because
it provides some features,like like variables, nesting,mixins etc 
Browser wont understand sass,it will beconverted to css

Why you need it
1)it helps developer to reduce repeatation of code
2)helps us to organise largestyle sheet

fetaures
1)write less do more

difference between sass and scss
1)sass supports 2 different types of sytax
1)indented .sass extension
2)scss(.scss extension)---->scss is basicaly syntax style,the way we write sass,looks very similar to css,so we will be preferring by writing scss 


Installation
1)open vs code
2)open extension
3)install live sass compiler from extrension(because sass should be converted to css)

STEPS
1)create filename.scss
2)right bottom click on watch sass(it will convert all scss to css)
3)to connect we must link css file which is created in html ref="stylesheet" <link href="filename.css"/>
4)write code in filename.scss
5)now you can write code


TOPICS
1)variables-for storing any data related to styling like bgcolor,color,fontsize etc,starts with $

ex
$bg-color:red;
$text-color:blue;
body{
background-color:$bg-color;
}

h1{
color:$text-color;
}


,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$fontsize-lg:50px;
$fontsize-sm:25px;

@media only screen and (max-width:600px){
h1{
font-size:$fontsize-lg
}

2)NESTING--//basically to write one element family
ex:
if theres a container and inside container there is h1
.container{
background-color:red;
h1{
font-size:78px;
}
}
}
..............................
map-similar like variables,but her we can store multiple values,and there will be key assigned to it
$font-size:("mobile":16px,"tablet":25px,"desktop":30px)

h1{
font-size:Lmpa-get($map:$font-size,$key:"tablet);
}


.......................................
5)AMPERSAND & target parent
ex:you are hovering over anchor tag
nav{
a{
text-decoration:none;
&:hover{
color:red;
}
}
}
//& is child targeting its parent thats anchor tag

6)MIXINS-Most and best useful feture,in layman terms its acts like function,if you design a layout ,many times
you are using similar proprties repeatedly,so if u these cases write it in mixins and use that mixin as single line of code

ex:

flex property
@mixin flexbox{
display:flex;
flex-direction:row;
justify-content:space around;
align-items:center;
}

so if you are using this above property repeatedly

how to include
@include flexbox;

bt what if you want to use space-betweent then
@mixin flexbox($fd,$jc){
display:flex;
flex-direction:$fd;
justify-content:$jc;
align-items:center;
}

how to include
@include flexbox(column,space-evenly);

you can give default

@mixin flexbox($fd,$jc,$ai:center){
display:flex;
flex-direction:$fd;
justify-content:$jc;
align-items:$ai;
}
//even if you didnt pass 3rd paramter,it will take center default
how to include
@include flexbox(column,space-evenly);


//used mainly in flex or button etc
..............................................
7)extend-i can inherit some css 
.button{
color:white;
padding:20px;
}

button{
@extend .button
}

............................................
8)partials-_common.scss
if i have many .scss files like 
about.scss
product.scss
list.scss
if you have common code which is to be similar in all 3 files,so if u have any code similar in files then put in _common.scss(underscore represtns partial)
and if you want to import in about.scss
then import "_common"

.................note
if accidently delete .css files,then you can recover by clicking on right bottom by restarting watching SASS
**if you want your .css files to be in separate folder
stop live sass compiler(right bottom)
*go to file-prefernces-settings-extension tab--find live sass compiler-scroll down-find format section-xyz save location-cclick onedit,,replace null to "CSS"
So hence forth all .css file which are generated aftercompiling will be in CSS FOLDER
